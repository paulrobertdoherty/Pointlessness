Good job!  Now try the other two buttons until you get 0, 0, and 0.
Very good! Here's another problem.
Well done!  This one's a bit more tricky.  See if you can figure it out.
That was fantastic!  You're going to do just fine.
You're doing great!
Another job well done!
I'm astounded!
Wow, you're doing really well!
This is amazing!
Huh, that was a big waste of time!
Solving these puzzles accomplishes nothing!
Yet you do them anyway, don't you!
It makes you happy, for some reason.
It makes you feel like you accomplished something.
And you deserve a break anyway.
Or, you think you do.
I don't know.
I'm just text.
All I do is say encouraging words so that you continue.
It gets tiring after a while.
I guess I should get going, then.
You're the master!
